# hiera_vault : a vault data provider function (backend) for Hiera 5

### Description

> Warning: master may be broken whilst this repo is upgraded for k/v v2 and newer Vault version upgrades! Please use the 0.1.0 tagged release in the meantime. This message will be removed and a 1.0.0 breaking release will be tagged on the Forge in the future.

This is a back end function for Hiera 5 that allows lookup to be sourced from Hashicorp's Vault.

[Vault](https://vaultproject.io) secures, stores, and tightly controls access to tokens, passwords, certificates, API keys, and other secrets in modern computing. Vault handles leasing, key revocation, key rolling, and auditing. Vault presents a unified API to access multiple backends: HSMs, AWS IAM, SQL databases, raw key/value, and more.

For an example repo of it in action, check out the [hashicorp/webinar-vault-hiera-puppet](https://github.com/hashicorp/webinar-vault-hiera-puppet) repo and webinar ['How to Use HashiCorp Vault with Hiera 5 for Secret Management with Puppet'](https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/hashicorp-vault-with-puppet-hiera-5-for-secret-management)

### Compatibility

- This module is only compatible with Hiera 5 (ships with Puppet 4.9+) and Vault KV engine version 2 (Vault 0.10+)

### Requirements

The `vault` and `debouncer` gems must be installed and loadable from Puppet

```
#Â /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/gem install --user-install vault
# /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/gem install --user-install debouncer
# puppetserver gem install vault
# puppetserver gem install debouncer
```

On Puppetserver <= 5, you will need to switch Puppetserver to use the new JRuby 9K, as the gem requires Ruby 2+, and Puppetserver uses the 1.9.2 JRuby

Some example Puppetcode to do so:

```puppet
ini_setting { "Change jruby to 9k":
  ensure            => present,
  setting           => 'JRUBY_JAR',
  path              => "/etc/sysconfig/puppetserver",
  key_val_separator => '=',
  section           => '',
  value             => '"/opt/puppetlabs/server/apps/puppetserver/jruby-9k.jar"',
  show_diff         => true,
  notify            => Service['puppetserver']
}

package { 'vault-puppetserver-gem':
  ensure   => 'present',
  name     => 'vault',
  provider => 'puppetserver_gem',
}
->
package { 'vault-puppetpath-gem':
  ensure   => 'present',
  name     => 'vault',
  provider => 'puppet_gem',
}
->
package { 'debouncer-puppetserver-gem':
  ensure   => 'present',
  name     => 'debouncer',
  provider => 'puppetserver_gem',
}
->
package { 'debouncer-puppetpath-gem':
  ensure   => 'present',
  name     => 'debouncer',
  provider => 'puppet_gem',
}
~> Service['puppetserver']

```

On Puppetserver >= 6, this is not needed as the default has been moved to the newer JRuby.

### Installation

The data provider is available by installing the `petems/hiera_vault` module into your environment:

This will avaliable on the forge, and installable with the module command:

```
# puppet module install petems/hiera_vault
```

You can also download the module directly:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/petems/petems-hiera_vault /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules/hiera_vault
```

Or add it to your Puppetfile

```ruby
mod 'hiera_vault',
  :git => 'https://github.com/petems/petems-hiera_vault'
```

### Hiera Configuration

See [The official Puppet documentation](https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/4.9/hiera_intro.html) for more details on configuring Hiera 5.

The following is an example Hiera 5 hiera.yaml configuration for use with hiera-vault

```yaml
---
version: 5

hierarchy:
  - name: "Hiera-vault lookup"
    lookup_key: hiera_vault
    options:
      confine_to_keys:
        - "^vault_.*"
        - "^.*_password$"
        - "^password.*"
      ssl_verify: false
      address: https://vault.foobar.com:8200
      token: <insert-your-vault-token-here>
      default_field: value
      mounts:
        some_secret:
          - %{::trusted.certname}
          - common
        another_secret:
          - %{::trusted.certname}
          - common
```

The following mandatory Hiera 5 options must be set for each level of the hierarchy.

`name`: A human readable name for the lookup

`lookup_key`: This option must be set to `hiera_vault`

The following are optional configuration parameters supported in the `options` hash of the Hiera 5 config

`address`: The address of the Vault server or Vault Agent, also read as `ENV["VAULT_ADDR"]`. Note: Not currently compatible with unix domain sockets - you must use `http://` or `https://`

`token`: The token to authenticate with Vault, also read as `ENV["VAULT_TOKEN"]` or a full path to the file with the token (eg. `/etc/vault_token.txt`). When bootstrapping, you can set this token as `IGNORE-VAULT` and the backend will be stubbed, which can be useful when bootstrapping.

`cache_for`: How long to cache a given key in seconds. If not present the response will never be cached.

`confine_to_keys:`: Only use this backend if the key matches one of the regexes in the array, to avoid constantly reaching out to Vault for every parameter lookup

```yaml
confine_to_keys:
  - "application.*"
  - "apache::.*"
```

`strip_from_keys`: Patterns to strip from keys before lookup

```yaml
strip_from_keys:
  - "vault:"
```

`default_field`: The default field within data to return. If not present, the lookup will be the full contents of the secret data.

`mounts`: The list of mounts you want to do lookups against. This is treated as the backend hiearchy for lookup. It is recomended you use [Trusted Facts](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/5.3/lang_facts_and_builtin_vars.html#trusted-facts) within the hierachy to ensure lookups are restricted to the correct hierachy points. See [Mounts](#mounts).

`ssl_verify`: Specify whether to verify SSL certificates (default: true)

`strict_mode`: Whether to fail loudly when we get a 403 response or no result from Vault. Otherwise we get an empty result, which means passwords could become empty strings.

`v1_lookup`: whether to lookup within kv v1 hierarchy (default `true`) - disable if you only use kv v2 :) See [Less lookups](#less-lookups).

`v2_guess_mount`: whether to try to guess mount for KV v2 (default `true`) - add `data` after your mount and disable to minimize amount of misses. See [Less lookups](#less-lookups).

### Debugging

```
puppet lookup vault_notify --explain --compile --node=node1.vm
Searching for "vault_notify"
  Global Data Provider (hiera configuration version 3)
    Using configuration "/etc/puppetlabs/code/hiera.yaml"
    Hierarchy entry "yaml"
      Path "/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/hieradata/node1.yaml"
        Original path: "%{::hostname}"
        No such key: "vault_notify"
      Path "/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/hieradata/common.yaml"
        Original path: "common"
        Path not found
  Environment Data Provider (hiera configuration version 5)
    Using configuration "/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/hiera.yaml"
    Hierarchy entry "Hiera-vault lookup"
      Found key: "vault_notify" value: "hello123"
```

### Vault Configuration

#### Mounts

It is recomended to have a specific mount for your Puppet secrets, to avoid conflicts with an existing secrets backend.

From the command line:

```
vault secrets enable -version=2 -path=some_secret kv
```

We will then configure this in our hiera config:

```yaml
mounts:
  some_secret:
    - %{::trusted.certname}
    - common
```

Then when a hiera call is made with lookup on a machine with the certname of `foo.example.com`:

```
$cool_key = lookup({"name" => "cool_key", "default_value" => "No Vault Secret Found"})
```

Secrets will then be looked up with the following paths:

- http://vault.foobar.com:8200/some_secret/foo.example.com/cool_key (for v1)
- http://vault.foobar.com:8200/some_secret/foo.example.com/data/cool_key (for v2)
- http://vault.foobar.com:8200/some_secret/data/foo.example.com/cool_key (for v2)
- http://vault.foobar.com:8200/some_secret/common/cool_key (for v1)
- http://vault.foobar.com:8200/some_secret/common/data/cool_key (for v2)
- http://vault.foobar.com:8200/some_secret/data/common/cool_key (for v2)

#### Less lookups

It is possible to use `cache_for` to indicate how long to cache a given key to lessen the number of requests sent to Vault.

You can use `v1_lookup` and `v2_guess_mount` to minimize misses in above lookups.

Changing above configuration to

```yaml
v2_guess_mount: false
v1_lookup: false
mounts:
  some_secret/data:
    - %{::trusted.certname}
    - common
```

would result in following lookups:

- http://vault.foobar.com:8200/some_secret/data/foo.example.com/cool_key (for v2)
- http://vault.foobar.com:8200/some_secret/data/common/cool_key (for v2)

#### Multiple keys in trusted certname

Often you want to whitelist multiple paths for each host (e.g. due to host having multiple roles). In this case simply add keys delimited with comma to trusted field. For example:

```yaml
mounts:
  secret:
    - "%{trusted.extensions.pp_role}"
```

and host configured with

```yaml
---
extension_requests:
  pp_role: api,ssl
```

would result in lookups in:

- http://vault.foobar.com:8200/secret/api/cool_key (for v1)
- http://vault.foobar.com:8200/secret/api/data/cool_key (for v2)
- http://vault.foobar.com:8200/secret/data/api/cool_key (for v2)
- http://vault.foobar.com:8200/secret/ssl/cool_key (for v1)
- http://vault.foobar.com:8200/secret/ssl/data/cool_key (for v2)
- http://vault.foobar.com:8200/secret/data/ssl/cool_key (for v2)

#### More verbose paths in Hiera

Often implicit path extension makes it hard to understand which exact paths are used for given host - as you need to inspect both Hiera and trusted field for each host.

With above configuration and lookup `$cool_key = lookup({"name" => "cool_key"})` you cannot be sure whether `api/cool_key` or `ssl/cool_key` will be used (whichever happens to be first in lookup list).

To alleviate this problem you can use full paths in Hiera, provided `v2_guess_mount: false` configuration is active. For example with:

```yaml
v2_guess_mount: false
v1_lookup: false
mounts:
  secret/data:
    - "%{trusted.extensions.pp_role}"
```

You can use `$cool_key = lookup({"name" => "ssl/cool_key"})` to ensure `http://vault.foobar.com:8200/secret/data/ssl/cool_key` will be used.

And make yourself a favor and avoid `lookup` directly ;) Use

```yaml
profile::ssl_role::key: "%{alias('vault_storage::ssl/params.key')}"
```

to inject value from `key` inside `http://vault.foobar.com:8200/secret/data/ssl/params`.
